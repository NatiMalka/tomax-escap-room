# Sound Effects for Escape Room

This directory contains sound effects used in the escape room game.

## Required Sound Files

1. `penalty-alarm.mp3` - A short, urgent alarm sound that plays when a time penalty is applied
2. `error-sound.mp3` - A shorter error beep for incorrect login attempts

These sound files should be downloaded from a royalty-free sound effect site like [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/), [Freesound](https://freesound.org/), or [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/).

## Sound Characteristics

- **penalty-alarm.mp3**: Should be 2-3 seconds long, with a descending tone that conveys urgency and danger. Think of a security system breach alarm.
- **error-sound.mp3**: Should be short (0.5-1 second), a simple error beep or buzzer sound.

## Usage

These sounds will play automatically within the escape room application when:
- A player enters incorrect login credentials (error-sound.mp3)
- A time penalty is applied after multiple failed login attempts (penalty-alarm.mp3)
